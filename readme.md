# Official iHorizon Repo :o

iHorizon is a Discord bot written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and using the [discord.js](https://npmjs.org/discord.js) module. It has a large variety of features, including moderation, invite management, guild configuration, fun commands, music playback, giveaways, and backu, and lot of more.

The bot was primarily developed by Kisakay (formerly known as Ezermoz) and was first released in September 2020 using discord.js v12. Now, It has a strong architecture with separated modules, each with their own owner directory. It also has a multi-language base, currently supporting English, French, Italian, German, and Japanese, with more planned for the future.

The bot is continuously under development.

There are no skidded scripts in the iHorizon source code, because talent is more important than being an idiot.

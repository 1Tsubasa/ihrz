# Official iHorizon Repo :o

iHorizon is a Discord bot written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and using the [discord.js](https://npmjs.org/discord.js) module. It has a large variety of features, including moderation, invite management, guild configuration, fun commands, music playback, giveaways, and backu, and lot of more.

The bot was primarily developed by Kisakay (*formerly known as Ezermoz*) and was first released in **September 2020** using **discord.js v12.** 
*Now, It has a strong architecture with separated modules, each with their own owner directory.*

*It also has a multi-language base**, currently supporting English, French, Italian, German, and Japanese, with more planned for the future.

**The bot is continuously under development.**

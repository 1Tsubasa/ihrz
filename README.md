# Very big announcement
<br>
`Dear iHorizon user,`
_We have some exciting news to share with you! We are currently undergoing a complete code restructuring for iHorizon, and this major re-code will be done in Typescript instead of JavaScript._

What does this mean for you? Let us explain the advantages and improvements that this transition will bring:

1. **Enhanced reliability and robustness**: TypeScript provides a static typing system that helps detect errors early during the development phase. This means the bot will be more resilient to errors and bugs, resulting in a smoother user experience.

2. **Increased developer productivity**: TypeScript offers advanced features such as type inference and auto-completion, enabling developers to work faster and more efficiently. This means we can develop new features and address your needs more quickly than before.

3. **Simplified maintenance**: By using TypeScript, we will have a clearer and better-organized code structure. This will facilitate ongoing maintenance of the bot, allowing us to resolve issues more rapidly and ensure long-term stability.

4. **Rich ecosystem**: TypeScript has gained significant popularity in the developer community, meaning there is a wide range of libraries, modules, and resources available to facilitate development and the addition of new features to iHorizon.

We understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding this transition. Rest assured that we are taking every effort to minimize disruptions and ensure a smooth transition to this new structure.

We are excited about this evolution and confident that it will further enhance the experience you have with iHorizon. Stay tuned for more announcements and exciting updates to come!

Thank you for your continued support,
<br>

## Skids's hall
There are no skidded scripts in the iHorizon source code, because talent is more important than being dumb. Skidding codes doesn't make you a developper, coding does. Skidding is only to flex and to lie to your friends.

## Origin
The bot was primarily developed by Kisakay (*formerly known as Ezermoz*) and was first released in **September 2020** using **discord.js v12.**<br>
Now, It has a strong architecture with separated modules, each with their own owner directory.
